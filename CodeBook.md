This file explains the data generated by running the **run_analysis.R** script.

##Input

The data used on this script can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
).

The data is on a folder called **UCI HAR Dataset**, we will only need the following files:

* activity_labels.txt
* features.txt
* subject_test.txt
* subject_train.txt
* X_test.txt
* X_train.txt
* y_test.txt
* y_train.txt

**Put all these files on your R working directory at the same level.**


##Output

Two datasets are generated, the first one exracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (dataset1.csv) for each measurement.

The second one (dataset2.csv) creates a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

##Variables
###Dataset1.csv

1. subjectnumber
2. data columns
3. activitycode
4. activitydescription


###Dataset2.csv

1. subject.activity
